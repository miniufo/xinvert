This is a `Python` package to invert or solve many classical problems in
atmospheric sciences and physical oceanography.  This geophysical fluid dynamics
(GFD) problems are formulated as second-order partial differential equations
(PDEs), and can be inverted using success-over relaxation (SOR) iteration with
proper boundary conditions.  This project is
`published on GitHub <https://github.com/miniufo/xinvert>`__ and can be cited
using its `Zenodo DOI <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7801501>`__.
